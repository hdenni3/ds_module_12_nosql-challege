Homework for Module  12 - nosql

During this activity United Kingdom restaurant data will be put into a database and queries will be ran. The data will focus on hygiene of the restaurants and the restaurants will be given a rating. Location data such as longitude and latitude will be available on the restaurants. Some data cleaning is needed based on the data request such as deleting restaurants from certain areas not being focused on. Once cleaning has concluded, several queries will be run through the database.
